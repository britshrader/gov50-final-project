## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the Prison Industrial Complex or Harvard's endowment. For the Prison Industrial Complex, I'm interested in exploring the relationship between de-institutionalization of disabled folks and the rise of the prisons. For Harvard's endowment, I am particularly interested in descriptive statistics, so I would still need to find questions that could be answered with regression.
